# Billboard-Hot100-and-Twitter-Engagement

I created this project to understand how the popularity of a song on Twitter affects its position on Billboard Hot 100 Charts. Another aim of this project is to showcase my skills as a data scientist. To do this, this project will be separated into three sections covering each area of data science. The first one is the process of getting the data and some tips for web scrapping. The second one is the data treatment using Pandas, numpy, and NLTK and some data viz. In the last one, we are using the data that we gathered and treated to create ML models to predict the rank of a song on Billboard's chart by the information collected from tweets.
